DEAD NO DATA
Tabular data

Marijuana legal areas (Canada pref, colorado etc) that have prision data
but they must also have what they were incaerated for but also any pennalties
they have recieved while in jail and create an app that allows suggestion for
early release for non violent drug offenders
--
DEAD NO TABULAR DATA FOR MIXED INPUT
Mixed Data (CV , NLP Sentiment? (other tabular

Predicting specific argiculture comodoity stock price using satalite CV
and then using sentiment analysis on how people feel about the comodoity outcome
and then use that sentiment to create an algorthim to determine range of stock
bet?

Stretch Goal
Aspect Sentiment analysis for hotel
Urgency detection

Super Stretch
API for website analyis

build a recommendation system for steam games using nlp + cattegories
https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets.html#goodreads

-----
Predict popularity and rating of yelp restaurant using image and review
for a mixed input keras
http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2017/final-reports/5244334.pdf
FLAWS: TOO POPULAR, who cares about rating

--------------
Satalite data
Use Cars overhead labeled dataset with 0.15 M per pixel to label satalite airbus
dataset or another high resolution dataset to predict stock price every year.
Multiple input dataset? stock price at each quarter is tabular + image dataset
need to use same encoder for each image that falls within a quarter

** STRETCH Goal
Create an aws pipline that could take in a live feed from a drone
and maybe use sagemaker instead of amazon rekognition
Pipline should have website level ui intake to upload drone video
https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-rekognition-video-analyzer

** remote sensing
** bing?
