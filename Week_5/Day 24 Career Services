ask the recruiter questions about who is on the team to connect with them
who are you interviewing with -- linkedin
what - do you have a JD?

STAR Exercise
"If someone on your team wasn't doing their job, how would you resolve the problem"
Situation: My friend and Coworker Jeff isn't doing his work, I would personally
talk to him and find out if there was anything outside of work that was taking
his focus away. If it was something that was solvable like he was stressed about
moving by himself I would help him move and let him know he wasn't alone. Results
would be a more productive Jeff
