2nd Thursday Career Services

Went over elevator pitches for everyone.

What does galvanize mean to you?

Galvanize is a program that trains and prepares me for datascience
interviews by providing technical training, as well as networking experience.

Don't be afraid to reach out to your network and let them know you're in the
program and that you'll be looking for work in less than 10 weeks now.
You'll be ready by then.
