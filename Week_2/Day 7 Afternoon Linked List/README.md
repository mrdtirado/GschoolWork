# Data Structures
Structuring data in unique ways allows us to to effectively and efficiently organize data, and in some cases, gives us unique insights into the way that data is stored. 
# Data Structures
Organizing data in particular ways is an extremely useful task, making common operations like sorting much more efficient.  There are also structured representations of data, such as graphs, that allow us to find unique connections between objects.  Later in the course, we'll be covering binary trees and graphs, both of which are important structures for organizing data.

This afternoon, we'll be focusing on a different data structure, the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Linked%20Lists/linked%20lists.html">linked lists</a>.  Linked lists are flexible data structures, that do a good job of setting a basis for understanding the code structure for binary trees and graphs.
